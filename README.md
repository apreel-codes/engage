Hi. Welcome to my engage README file.

engage is a full-stack CRUD web application that serves for faceless interaction. In engage, users can interact and drop opinions anonymously.

Users are able to register, login, logout, make a post, with or without a photo accompanying the post. Users are also able to make comments and replies anonymously under a post.

engage is still a work in progress and i look to adding more functionalities into the app.

engage uses Cloudinary to save photos in cloud and also heroku is the hosting platform.

This app is only available on the mobile platform now but this file will be updated as soon as the other screen sizes are available for it.
